      The Computer Science program at UIR is designed to provide students with a strong core understanding of the
      concepts
      of computation and information management using modern software and hardware. Computer Science teaches students
      problem solving techniques to create cutting-edge technology in domains ranging from mobile devices to healthcare
      to
      knowledge sharing. The goal of the computer science curriculum is to provide students with the knowledge and tools
      that allow them to design and implement effective and creative solutions for the needs of the society. The
      graduates
      are prepared to work for industry or government agencies, or are in private practice, be able to demonstrate
      competence and are successfully contributing to the Morocco computer science and information technology workforce.
